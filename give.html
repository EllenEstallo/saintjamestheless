  <div class="content">The stewardship of time is the careful, wise, and Godly use of the time God gives us.<br><br>Our time is a very precious gift given to us by God, but yet it can't be stored up like grain in a barn. Most of us feel we don't have enough time for all the things we want to do. Everyone is given the same amount of time; 24 hours each day, 168 hours each week. Once a moment passes, it is gone forever.<br><br>So the question becomes: How do we choose to use our time? </div>

    <ul>
      <li class="content">Receiving the Eucharist each week at Mass, we enjoy a unique union with Christ and, in him, with one another.  Here His love, indeed His very self, flows into His disciples and, through them and their practice of stewardship, to the entire human race.</li><br>
      <li class="content">Through daily prayer, we develop a closer personal relationship with God, sharing with Him our successes and failures, and asking for His guidance in our daily lives.</li><br>
      <li class="content">Reading Scripture daily helps us reflect on God's word.  It also tells of God's immense love for us.</li><br>

In return, it is in prudence that we pledge our commitment to take seriously our duty of care of the treasure you have shared.<br><br> We continually ask that you prayerfully examine your personal finances for an opportunity to lend support.</div>
